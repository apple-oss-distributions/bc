# Updating bc and regenerating the tests

1. Update the source code and tests, taking care to remove any files in bc/tests which are not present in the release tarball.

2. Build and install:

       xcodebuild build install

3. Generate the Makefile:

       (cd bc && CPPFLAGS=-D_DARWIN_C_SOURCE LC_ALL=C ./configure --disable-generated-tests --disable-problematic-tests --enable-editline)

   We disable generated and problematic tests because they are either very large or very slow and there is no compelling reason (e.g. known past regressions) to include them.

4. Regenerate the plist:

       ./tests/generate-tests.pl >tests/bc.plist

5. Commit everything:

       git add bc/tests tests
       git commit
